# LeetCode-50-SQL-to-PySpark Q&A
This repository contains my solutions to the top [50 LeetCode SQL](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/) challenges implemented using Apache Spark DataFrame (PySpark) and Spark SQL.

I have used the provided pandas schema from the website and converted it into a Spark DataFrame before solving them. I employed Jupyter Notebooks for easy readability.

Each Jupyter Notebook contains both the problem statement and my solution. To practice, clone the repo and clear out the shells containing the solutions and write your own PySpark or Spark SQL code to solve the challenge.
